<h2>Sarah Palin Has Gone Rogue</h2>

<h4>To The Tune of The Beatles "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Gjd_EAa64" target="_blank">Why Don't We Do It In The Road</a>"</h4>

<ul>
  <li>McCain is pissed Palin's gone rogue
  <li>She just tells him that he's too old
  <li>They are a bigger joke than Karl Rove
  <li>But Fox News has their audience snowed
  <li>The whole wide world is watching this
  <li>If McCain-Palin win - we'll be hosed<br/><br/>

  <li>Her Neiman Marcus card - it was closed
  <li>Could be booted from the Governor's abode
  <li>No clout her snow-machine - could be towed
  <li>For the bridge to nowhere - money's still owed
  <li>The whole wide world is watching this
  <li>Now Alaskans think she's a load<br/><br/>

  <li>Ooh<br/><br/>
  <li>To McCain's political grave - Palin drove
  <li>The GOP is in panic mode
  <li>She's looking at 2012 down the road
  <li>Dems' couldn't ask for a better gift than Palin rogue!
  <li>The whole wide world is watching this
  <li>Obama will pay Palin to have the White House lawn mowed
</ul>
